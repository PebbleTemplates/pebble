# Pebble ![Continuous Integration](https://api.travis-ci.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble.svg?branch=master)

Pebble is a java templating engine inspired by [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/). It separates itself from the crowd with its inheritance feature and its easy-to-read syntax. It ships with built-in autoescaping for security, and it includes integrated support for internationalization.

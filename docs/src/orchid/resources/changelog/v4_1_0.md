# BREAKING CHANGES
- Modify the `FileLoader` to use a mandatory sandboxed base directory parameter. (#715)
- If you do not provide a custom Loader, Pebble will now use only a `ClasspathLoader` by default, same as the spring autoconfiguration. (#715)
  Before that, it would have used an instance of the `DelegatingLoader` which consists of a `ClasspathLoader` and a `FileLoader` behind the scenes to find your templates.

# New Features
- Use a default existing format of `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ` when using date filter with a string (#677)
- Look for exact method / field match when doing reflection. Look for method get/is/has if none match
- Update some dependencies (#709)

# Bug Fixes
- NaN must return false instead of throwing an exception (#695)
- [CVE-2025-1686](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1686).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- If you do not provide a custom Loader, Pebble will now use only a `ClasspathLoader` by default, same as the spring autoconfiguration.
  Before that, it would have used an instance of the `DelegatingLoader` which consists of a `ClasspathLoader` and a `FileLoader` behind the scenes to find your templates.
- Modify the `FileLoader` to use a mandatory base directory parameter.

# Security
- Fix [CVE-2025-1686](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1686) (#715)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please DO NOT disclose it publicly until we’ve had a chance to fix it. Please don’t report security vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to disclose them responsibly.

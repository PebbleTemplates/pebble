   * The tag may be self contained like the "extends" tag or it may have a start and end point with
   * content in the middle like the "block" tag. If it contains content in the middle, it can use
   * parser.subparse(stopCondition) to parse the middle content at which point responsibility comes
   * back to the TokenParser to parse the end point.
   *
   * It is the responsibility of the TokenParser to ensure that when it is complete, the "current"
   * token of the primary Parser's TokenStream is pointing to the NEXT token. USUALLY this means the
   * last statement in this parse method, immediately prior to the return statement, is the
   * following which will consume one token:
   *
   * stream.expect(Token.Type.EXECUTE_END);
   *
   * Here are two relatively simple examples of how TokenParsers are implemented:
   *
   * - self contained: com.mitchellbosecke.pebble.tokenParser.SetTokenParser - middle content:
   * com.mitchellbosecke.pebble.tokenParser.BlockTokenParser
   *
   * @param token The token to parse
   * @param parser the parser which should be used to parse the token
   * @return A node representation of the token

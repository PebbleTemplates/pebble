   *
   * <p>
   * The resolve method can eventually add information to the cache key from the context (e.g. user
   * session information, servlet request etc.).
   *
   * <p>
   * As a concrete example if the loader loads a template created by a user form the database the
   * template name itself is not uniquely identify the template. The identification of the template
   * requires also the user which created the template. Hence for the key the user id and the
   * template name should be used. So the cache key is enhanced by some contextual information.
   *
   * <p>
   * The implementor of the method can add as many additional contextual information to the returned
   * object. However the following things needs to be considered:
   * <ul>
   * <li>This method will be called on each
   * {@link PebbleEngine#getTemplate(String)}. Hence the implementation needs to be fast and
   * eventually use some caching for the lookup process.</li>
   * <li>The returned object is used within a cache and hence needs to
   * implement {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode()}.</li>
   * <li>The object is kept in memory and hence it should not be to memory
   * heavy.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>
   * Depending on this implementation the {@link PebbleEngine#getTemplateCache()} should be tuned in
   * a way it can operate optimal. E.g. when the number of potential templates is infinite the cache
   * should evict some templates at some point in time otherwise the stability of the memory is not
   * given anymore.
   *
   * @param templateName The name of the template
   * @return Returns the cache key
